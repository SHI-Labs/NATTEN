# Changelog

## [Main branch]

## [0.17.1] - 2024-05-19
* Fixed interface for python 3.8 and 3.9

## [0.17.0] - 2024-05-02
* [Fused neighborhood attention](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/tree/main/docs/fna) (FNA) kernels
  * 1D, 2D and 3D Neighborhood Attention are supported,
  * Causal neighborhood attention is implemented,
  * Window (kernel) size, dilation, and causality can be defined *per-axis*,
  * All GPU architectures since Maxwell (SM50) are supported,
    * SM50 up to SM70 are SIMT-only, but support both FP16 and FP32,
    * SM70 and SM75 target Tensor Cores in FP16, and SIMT-style in FP32,
    * SM80 and above target Tensor Cores in FP16, BF16, and FP32.
  * NATTEN [Auto-tuner](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/blob/main/docs/fna/autotuner.md),
  * Memory preferences and [KV parallelism](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/blob/main/docs/fna/kv-parallelism.md) modes,
  * Relative positional biases are only supported in forward pass (inference).
  * Memory layout in FNA is different from existing kernels (`[B, *, heads, dim]` instead of `[B, heads, *, dim]`.)
    * Eventually this layout can skip over the permute/explicit reshape step in the attention module following
    the QKV projection.
    * For more refer to [Fused vs unfused NA](docs/fna/fused-vs-unfused.md). 
* Naive kernels now implement and allow causal masking,
* Naive kernels (CPU and CUDA) now allow varying parameters (window size, dilation, causal) across axes,
* Major bug fix in Volta GEMM kernels
  * The epilogue was different for Volta, and it slipped through unit tests,
  * Tests are now more aggressive, and the issue has been fixed.
* Memory alignment bug in half RPB gradient kernels fixed
  * See [#97](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/issues/97).

## [0.15.1] - 2024-01-24
* Attention tensors can now be views, which allows combining neighborhood and any other attention pattern (i.e. registers,
  cross attention tokens, and the like) without extra copies. ([#85](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/85) and [#87](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/87)).
* Minor bug fixes ([#86](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/86) and [#94](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/94)).

## [0.15.0] - 2024-01-09
* Refactored kernels
  * The backend is messy, particularly the CUDA backend. A step in the right direction is at least factoring out duplicated.
  * Out of the 7 operations in NATTEN's backend, 6 have duplicates (really 3 underlying ops with different inputs.)
  * See [#26](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/26) for more details.
* 3D Neighborhood Attention: naive CPU and CUDA kernels were added.
* Major refactoring of the C++ API ([#38](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/38), [#47](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/47), [#53](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/53), and [#81](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/81))
* GEMM kernels ([#38](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/38) and [#47](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/47))
* New build system with cmake ([#38](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/38), [#53](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/53), [#81](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/81))
* Bfloat16 support ([#38](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/38) and [#81](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/81))
* Kepler and Maxwell support ([#81](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/81))
* Forward mode automatic differentiation support ([#74](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/74))
* Experimental support for Nested Tensors (inference only) ([#76](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/76))
* Type checking, clang format, and other typesetting/formatting changes ([#80](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/80))
* Added profiling scripts ([#81](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/pull/81))

## [0.14.6] - 2023-03-21
Just a really small update that syncs the changes to the private branch.
It's mostly about the changed signature in both QK and AV (both 1D and 2D), where we now take in both kernel size and dilation.
Up to 0.14.4 we only took in dilation because QK always took in RPB, and RPB's shape is a function of kernel size, and AV took 
in attention weights, whose last axis is of size kernel size (kernel size squared in 2D).
As of 0.14.5, we support optional RPB, which means now we have to take in kernel size in QK. To make the signatures consistent,
we added kernel size to AV as well, along with assertions that kernel sizes match up, but that was not synced from the private
branch when we pushed out 0.14.5 because we wanted to support PyTorch 2.0 as soon as possible.
0.14.6 is just mostly to keep the master branch consistent with the latest release, since the signature difference would create
an inconsistency between the pip package and the master branch.

## [0.12] - 2022-07-09

  - This was handled previously with atomic adds (non-deterministic).

- New 1D NA kernels
  - Slightly more efficient.

### Changed

  - Makes extending support and editing easier.
- Gradchecks now run in fast mode (faster and less memory usage) unless instructed otherwise.
