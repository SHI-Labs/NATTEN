*Neighborhood Attention Extension*

Bringing attention to a neighborhood near you!

NATTEN is an extension to PyTorch, which provides the first fast sliding window attention with efficient CUDA kernels. 
It provides <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07143">Neighborhood Attention</a> (local attention)
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15001">Dilated Neighborhood Attention</a> 
(sparse global attention, a.k.a. dilated local attention) as PyTorch modules for both 1D and 2D data. 

## About NATTEN
Sliding window self attention mechanisms have been relatively overlooked, in part due to implementation difficulties.
For example, in a paper proposing one of the earliest examples of such methods, 
[SASA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/3416a75f4cea9109507cacd8e2f2aefc-Paper.pdf), 
it was noted that
although such methods are theoretically efficient, they're relatively slow in practice, compared to convolutions, 
which have been implemented in most well-known deep learning libraries.

That is why we started developing NATTEN, an extension to existing libraries with efficient implementations of sliding window
attention mechanisms, which will enable research in this direction including building powerful hierarchical vision
transformers.

For more information, we highly recommend reading our preprints [NAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07143) and
[DiNAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15001), and check out their [repository](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer).

### How fast is NATTEN?
The latest version of NATTEN runs pretty fast on Ampere with the latest torch and CUDA versions.

## Requirements
NATTEN supports PyTorch version 1.8 and later, and Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10(only torch >= 1.11), and 3.11 (only torch >= 1.13).

**NOTE:** The current version of NATTEN comes with Linux-only wheels, and supports Pascal and above (`SM >= 60`, i.e. Tesla P100).
Make sure your GPU is supported by referring to 
[this webpage](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/).
Future versions will extend support to older GPUs.

You may try and build from source on Windows, but do so at your own risk.
We also welcome contributions in all forms.

## Getting started

### Linux
Just refer to our website, [shi-labs.com/natten](https://www.shi-labs.com/natten/), select your PyTorch version and the CUDA
version it was compiled with, copy-paste the command and install in seconds!

For example, if you're on `torch==2.0.0+cu118`, you should install NATTEN using the following wheel:
```bash
pip3 install natten -f https://shi-labs.com/natten/wheels/cu118/torch2.0.0/index.html
```

More generally:
```bash
pip3 install natten -f https://shi-labs.com/natten/wheels/{cu_version}/torch{torch_version}/index.html
```

**NOTE:** If you do not specify a wheel URL, pip will collect NATTEN and try to compile on locally, which depending
on your system might take up to 30 minutes.
We strongly recommend using our website if you're a Linux user.

### Mac
Unfortunately we are not yet able to build Mac wheels, but you can compile on install, so just run:

```bash
pip3 install natten
```

### Windows
NATTEN should support Windows devices with CUDA, but does not yet have Windows wheels.
You can try and build NATTEN from source (see below).

### Build from source
Once you've set up your Python environment and installed PyTorch with CUDA, simply clone and build:

```bash
pip install ninja # Recommended, not required
git clone https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN
cd NATTEN
make
```

#### Optional: run unit tests
You can optionally run unit tests to verify building from source finished successfully:
```bash
make test
```

## Usage
Simply import `NeighborhoodAttention1D` or `NeighborhoodAttention2D` from `natten`:
```python
from natten import NeighborhoodAttention1D
from natten import NeighborhoodAttention2D

na1d = NeighborhoodAttention1D(dim=128, kernel_size=7, dilation=2, num_heads=4)
na2d = NeighborhoodAttention2D(dim=128, kernel_size=7, dilation=2, num_heads=4)
```

### FLOPs
We recommend counting flops through [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore).

```shell
pip install fvcore
```

Once you have fvcore installed, you can directly use our dedicated FLOP counter:
```python
from natten.flops import get_flops

flops = get_flops(model, input)
```

Alternatively, if you are using fvcore's `FlopCountAnalysis` directly, be sure to add our op handles:
```python
from fvcore.nn import FlopCountAnalysis
from natten.flops import add_natten_handle

# ...

flop_ctr = FlopCountAnalysis(model, input)
flop_ctr = add_natten_handle(flop_ctr)

# ...
```
